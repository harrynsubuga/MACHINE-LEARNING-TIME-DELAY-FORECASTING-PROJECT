This repository contains the full code used in my SEPnet Summer Placement project. The goal of the project was to train a machine-learning model to recover
the time delay between two images of a strongly-lensed Type Ia supernova. Strong gravitational lensing produces multiple images of a supernova that arrive 
at different times. Microlensing by stars in the lensing galaxy distorts the light curves and makes template fitting unreliable. In this project, I use a 
Random Forest regressor trained on simulated microlensed SN Ia light curves (from the H0LiSmokes dataset) to directly estimate the macro time delay 
from the curve shapes.
